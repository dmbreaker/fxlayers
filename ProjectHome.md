Note that this project uses the JavaFX Eclipse plugin and SDK 1.2:

The source code can be checked out directly as an Eclipse project. I recommend Eclipse 3.5 Java EE edition.

Status:

This is a work in progress in its initial stages. Finally got the basics working so the image layer and WGS 85 coordinate system is now working. Haven't got around putting up a live version but I guess I should be doing that soon so that progress can be looked at graphically.
